<p> <br/> Cultural appropriation came up in mass media in a big way when recently when Amandla Stenberg made a badass <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA">video</a> on the subject early this year. But people have been talking about it for while (and no one's been listening). <a href="http://jezebel.com/5959698/a-much-needed-primer-on-cultural-appropriation">Jezebel</a> wrote an article about it a while back, and a major take away I got from it is the same take away I got when controversy at my school arose when some white girls dressed in sombreros and fake mustaches and called themselves the "taco six", and the take away was this--<em> most people just don't care</em>. And sure, most of those people are white (surprise?), but a lot of them aren't.</p>
<p><br/> The counter argument always seems to be "we didn't mean it! we were just having fun!" And to be the annoying kid who says "well, it wasn't fun, it was hurtful" just isn't <em>cool</em>, especially for college kids. So everyone brushes it off, even the coloured kids, who know that, well, it isn't okay. </p>
<p> Which leads me to those iconic one-character chinese tattoos people have been sporting for some time. Because, my white friends, I know you don't mean any harm when you go to yoga three times a week and tell your friends how much peace you've achieved, or when you tell me that "tribal" is really in this summer, or when you set up a henna tattoo booth at your grad parties, or even when you go on vacation for two weeks and come back with cornrows. But, no matter how many times you say "you didn't mean it," the truth is, it does mean something. <br/></p>
<p> Obviously, it means different things for different people. For me, the white people all over Brooklyn with Chinese tattoos? They really do piss me off. They don't just piss me off because their stupid tattoos say "peace" and "joy" and I know for sure they either google translated the word right before stepping into the tattoo parlor or just asked the tattoo artist for the usual. No, they piss me off because it's those same guys with "love" in chinese written on their backs who made fun of me in grade 2 (yes, I say grade 2 I'm canadian) for bringing dumplings to school because my food "smelled funny". It's those same guys who have a dragon tattooed on their right triceps who fetishize me because they think my culture's women are submissive or docile and cat-call me on the streets with crude references to chinese food or some shit. <br/> </p>
<p> I hate your chinese tattoos because they remind me that you like chinese culture to the extent that you get to make your body look less boring and white person-ish. You get to look cultured, and hip. But as for me? When you see me on the street, I'm still just another Asian girl. When you find out I'm a compsci and math major with a 2400 SAT, you'll chuckle to yourself (no surprise there). You'll walk through chinatown on your tip-toes and sigh to yourself at how dirty the sidewalks are. You'll walk through central park and laugh at all the asian families take selfies on the selfie sticks and traveling in large packs of chinese tour groups. You'll roll your eyes when your two neighbors talk to each other in mandarin ("Learn English, this is America!"), and maybe you'll even go home and search asian on pornhub to fulfil some crude fantasy about dominating the most submissive race. <br/> </p>
<p> And you know what? I'll say it, fuck you guy with chinese tattoos. Fuck you for getting to embrace my culture, while I'll always get made fun of when I do. Fuck you for exploiting my culture to make a statement about how "hip" you are, while making no attempt to understand my culture or even to accept it and my people. <br/></p>
<p>Fuck you for liking your chinese tattoo way more than you like chinese people.</p>
