  tl;dr I'm a college student finding her way in the world of hacking
  </br>
  </br>
  </h4>
  <p> My first experience of coding outside of class was a hackathon in new york
  city. I did what any confused, inexperienced girl in a sea of experienced male
  hackers would do - I pretended to know more than I did. Well that didn't work
  out great for me... they kept throwing words at me I didn't know like "bashrc"
  and "database". Luckily, I ended up pairing with a mentor and building a sinatra
  app from scratch, and I learned a lot. 
  </br></br> 
  A year later, I knew way more than I ever thought I would about the world of coding,
  open source, and hacking. And so I decided to write a blog, to help people like me
  who are occasionally helpless and confused, to help myself remember everything
  I learned, and to teach myself how to teach.
  </br></p>
  <p> I'm currently a sophomore at Williams College, a tiny liberal arts school
  in eastern Massachussetts, studying Math and Computer Science (shocker). 
  I was born in Toronto, Canada (aka the 6). </p>
  <p>Hopefully I can help some others out there who find themselves in the same
  confused holes I was before I wrote each of these blog posts :) </p>
