My blog from my summer living in NY and interning at CipherHealth June 2015 - August 2015. About coding, cool things I've learned, and random thoughts I have in the middle of the night (topics include cultural appropriation and the occasional existential crisis). 

Made with Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap.
