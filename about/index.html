  <p> My first experience of coding outside of class was a hackathon in new york
  city. I did what any confused, inexperienced girl in a sea of experienced male
  hackers would do - I pretended to know more than I did, I feigned interest in design and front-end cause none of the guys wanted to do it, and I took a back seat as the rest of them discussed what project we'd embark on. Well, that didn't work
  out great for me... they kept throwing words at me I didn't know like "bashrc"
  and "database". Luckily, I ended up pairing with a mentor and building a sinatra
  app from scratch, and I learned a lot.
  </br></br> 
  A year later, I knew way more than I ever thought I would about the world of coding,
  open source, and hacking, mostly thanks to an internship I took over the summer at a
  health tech company. Our main mentor that summer suggested we write a blog, and at first
  I thought he was crazy. But through reading <a href="http://hardscrabble.net">his</a> I
  started to think maybe it wasn't such a crazy idea. And so I decided to write a blog, to help people like me
  who are occasionally helpless and confused, to help myself remember everything
  I learned, and to teach myself how to teach (and also to have an outlet when its midnight and a thought pops in my head).
  </br></p>
  <p> I'm currently a sophomore at Williams College, a tiny liberal arts school
  in western Massachussetts, studying Math and Computer Science (shocker).
  I was born in Toronto, Canada (aka the 6). </p>
  <p>Hopefully I can help some others out there who find themselves in the same
  confused holes I was before I wrote each of these blog posts :) </p>
